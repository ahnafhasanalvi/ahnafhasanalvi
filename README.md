## Hello (Peace Be Upon You)!ðŸŒ»
I'm Ahnaf Hasan Alvi (AL Hasan) 
Hello, World. I do not program to get a job or build a career in tech. I do it because I want to understand how computers think, how logic flows and how systems are built. I see code as a language, not just of machines, but of structure, behavior and even power. Iâ€™m interested in how rules are written, how information moves and what that says about the world we live in. I'm a polymath, I learn across disciplines, from psychology to law to science, and programming is one of the tools I use to connect those dots. I believe that understanding code helps me understand society, nature and even myself.
